## Features

The app currently support:

- [x] Realtime image with facial recognition (slow)
- [x] Displaying Facial Features
- [x] Displaying Facial Features information (eyes open %, etc...)
- [x] Displaying emotional status of the detected face

## Motivation

I built this app to know more about the real-life application of machine learning and AI. As well as trying to implement and learn more about firebase ML package.

## Future Updates

- [ ] Make real-time recognition faster
- [ ] Upgrading the facial scanning with better UI and animation
- [ ] Hunting down more bugs if needed üê±‚Äçüë§
